# Spaceship Titanic Data Analysis
## by Babajide Alao


## Dataset

> The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched some months ago. With over 8,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle

> This data set contains 8,693 rows with each row being an information about each passengers and 14 variables which describes the passengers. The dataset contains features like PassengerId, HomePlanet, Cabin, Destination, Transported, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there is no significant differnce between the number of passengers that was transported and those that were not. It is also worthy to note that the Spa, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall and VRDeck Services does not impact the probability of being transported.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focused on the variable that increases the probability of being transported
55 Cancrie has more passengers that was transported against those that weren't. So i believe Passengers going to 55 Cancrie has higher probability of getting transported.
Being a passenger from Europa increases your chances of being transported.
The 40-59 age range has higher probability of being transported.
More passengers in Deck G was transported compared to other Decks.
Passengers in Starboard( Side S) has a higher probability of being transported compared to Port(Side P).
Majority of the Passengers that opted to sleep throughout the voyage was transported.
